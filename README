This file is hardcoded to the web-Stanford.txt file

This file will introduce a list of nodes and directed connected edges

Output is as follows:

Number of Nodes
Number of Edges
Largest SCC (strongly connected components [digraph])
Number of Edges in SCC
Largest WCC (weakly connected components [undirected graph]) 
Number of Edges in WCC

To Run type "python Prog2.py"

Thanks!
